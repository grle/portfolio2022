      <h2 class="top-space">RESEARCH</h2>
      <hr class="green-line">
      </hr>
      <p>It’s difficult to run a competitive analysis. It turns out most auto mechanics do not use websites, and those that do exist are poorly designed. There are websites for chains that have multiple locations, but they do not work well for the client’s situation. This could be because it appears that the best way to find a local mechanic is through sites like Yelp or Google Maps. For websites that do exist, however, there is some consistency. For instance, the phone number and location is prominently featured, as well as a list of service most people would need.</p>
      </br>

      <h2 class="top-space">STORYTELLING</h2>
      <hr class="green-line">
      </hr>
      <p>The client’s auto shop is family-owned and located in a small town in Washington. While his lack of interest in technology could be seen as a downside, I decided to lean into this and design his website with an old-fashioned, vintage look. I coded a very simple static website with no frills and adopted a no-nonsense language that conveyed small-town friendliness. For the content, I put a strong emphasis on integrity and honesty. I also highlighted his ties to the town (for instance, his upbringing and college education all happened in that area) to indicate that he has community support as a local businessman. </p>
      </br>

      <h2 class="top-space">COPYWRITING</h2>
      <hr class="green-line">
      </hr>
      <p>I received all the content that the client wanted to share and edited them so as to reflect the appropriate tone for the website. I also made sure to include redundancies on the client’s phone number so that the users know how to contact him for services.</p>

      <p>I coded the website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While the website could be more sophisticated if it was made with React, the scrappy nature of how this site was coded also suites the theme of this business.</p>

      <ul class="bullet-points threeqtr-size">
        <li>MINISTRY PAGE: </br>The client was unable to locate the
          full documents detailing the missions they participated in
          when they were in the Global South, which delayed the page from
          being fully fleshed out. When the information becomes readily
          available, it will then be possible to finish that portion of the
          website.</li>
        <li>KOREAN LANGUAGE: </br>Because many members looking for
          this website are Korean speakers, it is important to add a Korean
          language component to this website in the future.</li>
        <li>USER TESTING: </br>More testing is required so we can make
          adjustments needed to make sure this website is easy for the
          senior population to navigate.</li>
        <li>SOCIAL MEDIA: </br>Create a Facebook page for the ministry and
          include that on the website, since it could help with outreach.
          If they are interested in expanding, this might be a good resource
          to have.</li>
