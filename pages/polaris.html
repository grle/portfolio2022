        Inc. which is a private practice for Dr. Jeehee Kim, an
        ophthalmologist located in the Bay Area. She needed a website that

        specifically her specialization in cornea surgery. </p>

          <p>Redesign the outdated and clunky website, which is difficult

            <li>Research necessary components needed for the website to

      <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li>Because of Dr. Kimâ€™s focus on eye surgery, a majority of her
          regular clients are 60+ years old. The website needs to be simple
          and easy to navigate to accommodate people who may struggle with
          technology. </li>
        <li>Due to the target demographic of the audience, the website needs
          to use a larger font to accommodate viewers with limited eyesight. </li>
        <li>Most people find out about Polaris Eye through insurance
          providers. The website should also focus on standing out locally,
          as it represents a private practice.</li>

      <h2 class="top-space">COPYWRITING</h2>
      <hr class="green-line">
      </hr>
      <p>The client had a series of documents detailing different medical
        conditions and surgical procedures that she wanted to put on the
        website. However, it was significantly more detailed and complex
        such that the layperson would struggle to understand the medical
        terminology and go through the dense material. The goal was to make
        sure that the information was accessible enough for the users to
        easily read and understand. I went through the documents and
        simplified the language; however, because the client wanted to
        maintain the integrity of the original document as much as possible,
        we also had to compromise on the final document.</p>
      </br>

      <h2 class="top-space">FINAL WEBSITE</h2>
      <hr class="green-line">
      </hr>
      <p>We published the website on Wix mainly because the client wanted the
        freedom to edit the material herself. Previously, she had her website
        managed by a design studio and she did not like that she had to ask them
        to make changes, especially since they were often slow to get back to
        her. Because Wix happened to have the easiest UI for her and included
        business features that can help her take appointments from her clients,
        we decided that this would best suit her needs.</p>

      <h2 class="top-space">WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
      <hr class="green-line">
      </hr>
      <p>It was interesting to complete this project while working closely with
        a client who doesnâ€™t have any knowledge about design principles. The
        client favored a brutalist style and wanted this website to accommodate
        her aesthetic choices, even though it would go against the font
        hierarchy, color scheme, or the style guide in general. We managed to
        negotiate things such that she was able to be satisfied with the final
        product while maintaining some consistency with the design choices. I
        came out of this experience learning that it was important to be able to
        work with a client to figure out what they want and make compromises as
        needed, according to the situation at hand.</p>
      </br>

      <!-- <h2 class="top-space">NEXT STEPS</h2>
      <hr class="green-line">
      </hr>
      <ul class="bullet-points threeqtr-size">
        <li>MINISTRY PAGE: </br>The client was unable to locate the
          full documents detailing the missions they participated in
          when they were in the Global South, which delayed the page from
          being fully fleshed out. When the information becomes readily
          available, it will then be possible to finish that portion of the
          website.</li>
        <li>KOREAN LANGUAGE: </br>Because many members looking for
          this website are Korean speakers, it is important to add a Korean
          language component to this website in the future.</li>
        <li>USER TESTING: </br>More testing is required so we can make
          adjustments needed to make sure this website is easy for the
          senior population to navigate.</li>
        <li>SOCIAL MEDIA: </br>Create a Facebook page for the ministry and
          include that on the website, since it could help with outreach.
          If they are interested in expanding, this might be a good resource
          to have.</li>
